# Machine Learning Operations: Customer Churn Prediction

This project was developed for the MLOps course in the Master's Degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics (NOVA IMS). It is a course with fewer credits than the main ones, meaning it is mostly introductory to the area.

The problem (hotel churn prediction) was chosen from another class, as the main goal from this project was to go more into the Model Deployment and Monitoring phases. All code was developed in Python. 

## Main Steps (beyond normal classification steps)

- Separate the project into sprints
- Data Unit tests
- Building all pipelines with Kedro
- Monitoring experiences with MLFlow
- Automate checks for Data Drift.
